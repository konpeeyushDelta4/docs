## Problem Space Analysis

### Current Industry Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Passive Information Delivery">
    - Most AI assistants provide information but don't take action
    - Users must manually implement suggestions across different parts of the interface
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disjointed User Experience">
    - Traditional UIs separate help/documentation from functional controls
    - Users must context-switch between learning and doing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complex Feature Discovery">
    - Advanced features remain hidden behind menus and documentation
    - Technical terminology creates barriers to understanding capabilities
  </Accordion>

### Scenario 1: New User Onboarding

<CodeGroup>
```dialogue New User Conversation
User: "Hi, I'm new to YourGPT. Where should I start?"

Bot: "Welcome! Let's get you started. Would you like to:
1. Take a quick tour of the main features
2. Build your first conversation flow 
3. Learn about how YourGPT can help with your specific needs"

User: "Let's build my first flow"

Bot: "Great choice! I'll guide you through creating a basic conversation flow. First, let's understand what flows are." 
[Displays simple animated diagram explaining flows]
"Ready to create your first one? I can help you build a simple greeting flow."
```
</CodeGroup>

### Scenario 2: Feature Control

<CodeGroup>
```dialogue Theme Switching
User: "I'd like to switch to dark mode"

Bot: "Switching to dark mode now!"
[Theme changes immediately]
"You can also try our other themes like Aurora or Ocean. Would you like to preview any of these?"

User: "Show me Aurora"

Bot: "Here's a preview of the Aurora theme:"
[Displays theme preview]
"Would you like to switch to this theme or go back to dark mode?"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Scenario 3: Advanced Feature Discovery

<CodeGroup>
```dialogue Learning About Entities
User: "What are entities and how do they work?"

Bot: "Entities are specific pieces of information you want to extract from user messages. For example, in 'Book a flight to Paris,' 'Paris' would be a location entity."
[Displays interactive card showing entity types]
"Would you like to:
1. See examples of different entity types
2. Learn how to create your own entities
3. See how entities connect with intents in a flow"
```
</CodeGroup>
