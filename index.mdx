## Engaging Waiting Experiences

<Note>
The Emoji Riddle Game transforms the traditionally frustrating waiting period between user support requests and operator connection into an engaging, interactive experience. By combining clever emoji puzzles with gamification elements, this solution dramatically reduces perceived wait times while providing a novel approach to customer retention during transition periods.
